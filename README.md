Soundmap
========
A demo to use RxJava, Retrofit, Gson, Google Maps, Dagger 2, Picasso and AppCompat with data provided by the fantastic Freesound project API (http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/overview.html)

You can search for sounds via keywords and the top results will be displayed in their corresponding geographic location.

It also demos pure JUnit tests with the Android Gradle plugin. Unfortunately, these
tests require that the resources directory is included on the classpath, which doesn't work just yet.
