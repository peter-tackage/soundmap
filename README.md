Soundmap
========
A demo to use RxJava, Retrofit, Gson, Google Maps, Dagger 2, Picasso and AppCompat with data provided by the fantastic Freesound project API (http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/overview.html)

You can search for sounds via keywords and the top results will be displayed in their corresponding geographic location.
